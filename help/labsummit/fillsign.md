# Fill and Sign any form on desktop or mobile

Fill, sign, and send forms fast from your desktop, browser, or mobile app. Adobe Sensei recognizes and saves commonly used data for use in a PDF form. Create a signature by drawing, importing a scan, or typing your name then securely apply it to a document.

In this exercise, you will import, fill, sign, and send a from using your mobile device.

**Step 1:** Download the [!DNL Adobe Fill & Sign] app from the [!DNL Apple App] store or [!DNL Google Play].

**Step 2:** Open the app, tap **[!UICONTROL Select a form to fill out]**.
