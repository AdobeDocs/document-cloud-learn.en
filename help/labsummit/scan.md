# Go Digital with Adobe Scan

De-clutter, organize, or share! There’s no need to keep piles of paper on your desk or stuff receipts in your wallet. The Adobe Scan mobile app scans paper documents directly into PDFs, and automatically recognizes text.

In this exercise, you will upload contents from a business card directly into your contacts. Scan and store a receipt.

Collect a business card, receipt, or some other paper item that you'd like to work with.

## Scan a business card

**Step 1:** Download the Adobe Scan app from the Apple App store or Google Play.

**Step 2:** Open the Adobe Scan app.

**Step 3:** From the app, take a photo of the business card containing the contact information you’d like to save to your phone.
