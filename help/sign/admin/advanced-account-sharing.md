# Advanced account sharing

Learn how to set up advanced account sharing--allowing admins and users to delegate their send, modify, and view permissions. Account sharing is perfect for situations when a user is going on vacation or leave of absence. Or, you can create a virtual user account, like an HR management user account, and then give permission to multiple users within the HR group who can all act on behalf of the virtual user.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Advanced Account Sharing is only available for Enterprise-level plans. Technical Support can enable Advanced Sharing but once it is enabled, it changes the relationships of the shared objects in a way that cannot be reversed. For this reason, it is recommended that you contact your Adobe Account Team and have a trial account set up for you to test the functionality and verify it permits everything that you want to accomplish.
