# Modifying a document after sending

Learn how to modify a document that's already been sent out for signature--like when the wrong document is sent out by mistake. Modifying agreements can only be used on documents that meet the following criteria:

* The document has not been signed, approved, or delegated
* The document does not include a digital signature or written signature
* The document has not been initiated from a custom workflow


>[!NOTE]
>
>Modifying a document after sending is only available for enterprise-level plans. Your Acrobat Sign administrator may need to enable the **Modify Agreements** setting in the **Send Settings** section of the **Account Settings** to use this feature.
