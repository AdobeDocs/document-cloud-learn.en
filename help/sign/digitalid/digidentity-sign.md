# Register and sign using [!DNL Digidentity]

Digidentity is an EU qualified trust service provider (QTSP). The Digidentity identification and onboarding process relies on the Digidentity mobile app and requires use of an identity document with an embedded NFC chip as well as an NFC-compatible mobile device. The Digidentity process is completely self-service and is available 24/7/365, with no "human in the loop". In most cases, it takes as little as 5-10 minutes to complete registration.

This video tutorial details the user journey from receipt of the registration invitation email to using a digital ID to authenticate and apply a cloud signature in Acrobat Sign.
