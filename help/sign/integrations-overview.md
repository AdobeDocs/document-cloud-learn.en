# Integrate Overview

We partner with other companies, so you can use Adobe Sign with other applications your organization already uses, such as Microsoft, Salesforce, and Workday to name a few. Check out how you can simplify your e-signature workflows through the processes in these integration tutorials. 

>[!NOTE]
> If you're having trouble accessing any of these features, check with your organization's administrator to ensure the integration is enabled.
