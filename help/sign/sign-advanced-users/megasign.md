# Send in Bulk

Learn how to send and collect thousands of signatures in just a few short steps saving your organization hours of time. Everyone gets their own document to sign, and you can track the progress of each individual that you've sent the document toâ€”so you know exactly who or who hasn't signed. Each online signature you capture is safe, secure, and legally valid.
