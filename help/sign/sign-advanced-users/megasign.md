# Collect signatures in bulk

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to collect hundreds of signatures for a COVID 19-liability waiver in just a few short steps. Everyone gets their own liability waiver to sign, and you can track the progress of each individual waiver--so you know exactly who or who hasnâ€™t signed. Each online signature you capture is safe, secure, and legally valid.
