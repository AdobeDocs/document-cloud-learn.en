# Send & collect signatures in bulk

Learn how to collect hundreds of signatures in just a few short steps. In this use case, everyone gets their own liability waiver to sign, and you can track the progress of each individual waiver--so you know exactly who or who hasn't signed. Each online signature you capture is safe, secure, and legally valid. 

Check out this additional real-world [Telework agreement](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/document-cloud-learn/sign-learning-hub/expand/recipes/gov/usecasegovtelework.html?lang=en) use case.
