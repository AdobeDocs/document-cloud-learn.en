# Adobe Sign Text Tagging

In this recorded webinar (no registration necessary), you'll learn how to build Adobe Sign form fields with text tagging using Adobe Acrobat DC. Text tagging significantly reduces the time it takes to build and revise documents with many form fields. Document senders don't need to place individual fields on every documentâ€”-another significant time saver. Other benefits include form field validation (accurate and error free data collection) and professional form design consistency. Feel free to send us your questions during the webinar through the Q&A pod. Click on the image below to begin watching the recording.
