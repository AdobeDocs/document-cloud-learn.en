# Work with your SharePoint files

Streamline document workflows with SharePoint and Acrobat DC using the [Adobe Document Cloud PDF Experience for Office 365](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/adobeinc.adobe-document-cloud-pdf?tab=Overview). Securely convert Microsoft 365 files to PDFs, combine documents into one file, comment, and rearrange pages â€” right from SharePoint online.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Document Cloud for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Office 365 includes free features (such as viewing and searching within PDFs) available to all users. Some features (such as creating and combining PDFs) require a paid Acrobat DC for teams or Acrobat DC for enterprise subscription.
