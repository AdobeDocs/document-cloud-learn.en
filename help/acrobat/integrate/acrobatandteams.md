# PDF collaboration in [!DNL Microsoft Teams]

Adobe Acrobat for Teams allows users to collaborate and work with colleagues by viewing, annotating, and reviewing PDFs without ever leaving [!DNL Microsoft Teams]. This integration includes:

* High quality viewing – this is only PDF viewing experience that lets you open high-fidelity PDFs directly within [!DNL Microsoft Teams], for a satisfying and seamless work experience
* Streamline PDF reviews — collect channel members’ feedback in a single PDF directly in [!DNL Microsoft Teams] instead of gathering and reconciling feedback via multiple attachments
* Stay notified of progress — get notified in Teams when others take action on your documents
* Keep reviewers informed — reviewers get notified when others reply to their comments
* Secure collaboration – collaborate securely with trusted members and retain the ability to store document versions in [!DNL Microsoft SharePoint] or [!DNL OneDrive]
