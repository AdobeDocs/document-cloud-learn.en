# PDF collaboration in Microsoft Teams

Adobe Acrobat for Teams allows users to collaborate and work with colleagues by viewing, annotating, and reviewing PDFs without ever leaving Microsoft Teams. This integration includes:

* High quality viewing – this is only PDF viewing experience that lets you open high-fidelity PDFs directly within Microsoft Teams, for a satisfying and seamless work experience
* Streamline PDF reviews — collect channel members’ feedback in a single PDF directly in Microsoft Teams instead of gathering and reconciling feedback via multiple attachments
* Stay notified of progress — get notified in Teams when others take action on your documents
* Keep reviewers informed — reviewers get notified when others reply to their comments
* Secure collaboration – collaborate securely with trusted members and retain the ability to store document versions in Microsoft SharePoint or OneDrive
