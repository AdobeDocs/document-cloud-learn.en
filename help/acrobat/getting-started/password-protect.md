## How protecting PDFs help different teams

* **Legal**

  Protecting PDFs ensures confidential contracts, case files, and client communications can only be accessed by authorized parties, reducing compliance and privacy risks.

* **Sales**

  Protecting proposals, pricing sheets, and partner agreements ensures competitors or unauthorized stakeholders can't access strategic information.

* **HR**

  Securing PDFs protects employee records, performance reviews, and hiring documents, helping maintain privacy and meet regulatory requirements.

* **Finance**

  Password protection keeps sensitive financial reports, forecasts, and customer data secure, helping prevent unauthorized access and potential fraud.

* **Procurement**

  Password-protecting PDFs keeps supplier contracts, bids, and pricing documents secure, ensuring only authorized stakeholders can access sensitive negotiation and sourcing information.
