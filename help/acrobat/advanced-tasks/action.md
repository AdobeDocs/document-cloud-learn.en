1. In the **Create New Action** dialog box, add commands to the action by selecting a task from the list on the left and clicking the arrow in the center to add it to the column on the right.

    *Settings for each task can be pre-determined in this dialog box, or you can allow the user to be prompted to make any necessary decisions as the action runs.*
