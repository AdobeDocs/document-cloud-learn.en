# Optimize PDFs for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Learn how to optimize a PDF for improved discoverability and search engine ranking on the web.

## Create unique content

Create PDF content that is different from the information your web pages. 

+++View details on how to create unique content

PDF content should be unique and structured as follows:

*   Use a single main heading/title beginning with a keyword
*   Use keyword subheadings organized in a hierarchical structure
*   Use short paragraphs containing keywords and lists
*   Add internal and external (content on your website or other websites) hyperlinks
*   Add a hyperlinked table of contents for documents longer than 25 pages
*   Run [text recognition](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/document-cloud-learn/acrobat-learning/getting-started/scan-and-ocr.html) on all scanned documents
*   Build PDFs that are mobile friendly
    To check the mobile viewing experience of your PDF, open the file in the [Acrobat Reader mobile app](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/acrobat-reader.html) and turn on Liquid Mode. Include additional subheadings if necessary to improve navigation.

## Prepare for web

Optimize the experience of interacting with your PDF by preparing it for web viewing and reducing the file size.

This step reduces the file size and enables **Fast Web View** in the PDF. **Fast Web View** allows the file to be immediately opened, viewed, and searched before the entire file is streamed or downloaded—-creating an optimal end-user experience. Open **[!UICONTROL Document Properties]** (*Ctrl + D* on Windows or *Cmd + D* on Mac) to determine if **Fast Web View** is enabled.

## Create a keyword filename

+++View details on how to create a keyword filename

Create a keyword filename as follows:

The filename becomes part of the URL when a PDF is posted on the web. A good practice is to match your keyword-optimized title with the filename. To be search-friendly—use lowercase, no punctuation or hashes, and avoid stop words (a, an, the, and, it, for, or, but, in, my, your, our, and their, etc.). If you use separate words, add hyphens or underscores between the words.

## Secure your PDF

The last step is to protect your PDF to prevent unauthorized changes. 

+++View details on how to secure your PDF

Secure a PDF as follows:

1.  Open **[!UICONTROL Document Properties]** (*Ctrl + D* on Windows or *Cmd + D* on Mac) and select the **[!UICONTROL Security]** tab.
1.  Check **[!UICONTROL Printing editing and printing of the document. A password will be required in order to change these settings.]**
1.  Under **[!UICONTROL Changes Allowed:]** select **[!UICONTROL None]**.
1.  Check **[!UICONTROL Enable text access for screen reader devices for the visually impaired.]**
