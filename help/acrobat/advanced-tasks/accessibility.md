# Preparing Accessible PDF files

Learn how to check the accessibility of your existing PDF files. The **Full Check/Accessibility Check** tool verifies whether the document conforms to accessibility standards, such as PDF/UA and WCAG 2.0. The **Accessibility Report** summarizes the findings of the accessibility check.

You can also use the Make Accessible action in the [Action Wizard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/document-cloud-learn/acrobat-learning/advanced-tasks/action.html) tool, which walks through a basic set of steps to create an accessible PDF.

## Fix accessibility issues

In the accessibility report window, right-click on an item to bring up the context menu. The context menu for any item that failed the accessibility check gives you the option to fix the issue.

*Please note: some issues cannot be fixed automatically and will need your manual intervention to correct the problem. In those cases, Acrobat present a dialog box telling you what to correct.*
