You can also use the [!UICONTROL Make Accessible] action in the [Action Wizard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/document-cloud-learn/acrobat-learning/advanced-tasks/action.html) tool, which walks through a basic set of steps to create an accessible PDF.

## Fix accessibility issues

In the accessibility report window, right-click on an item to bring up the context menu. The context menu for any item that failed the accessibility check gives you the option to fix the issue.

>[!NOTE]

>Some issues cannot be fixed automatically and need your manual intervention to correct the problem. In those cases, >Acrobat presents a dialog box telling you what to correct.
