# Working with form data

If you have a set of completed forms and need to compile the data, you can use Acrobat to merge the responses into a single spreadsheet.

1. Start by putting all your completed PDF forms into a folder on your computer.

    Acrobat extracts the data from each form and creates a spreadsheet of all the data.
