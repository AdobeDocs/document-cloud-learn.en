# Making PDF ballots more Accessible

PDF ballots that are available electronically need to be accessible to and usable by all voters. This Webinar will cover some key areas of PDF accessibility necessary to allow users of assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to read and complete their ballots.

This session will focus on improving the accessibility of existing electronic ballots - to make ballots fully accessible and usable for all users may require a more comprehensive process. We will address high-priority changes that can be made to make your current PDF ballot able to be used by more users, including users who are blind or low-vision and users who depend on a keyboard to view and interact with the ballot.
